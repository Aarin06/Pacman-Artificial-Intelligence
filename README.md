# Pacman-Artificial-Intelligence

This repository contains my solutions to the **Pacman AI Projects** from the UTSC CSCD84 Intro to Artificial Intelligence course. These projects cover key AI concepts, ranging from search algorithms to reinforcement learning, all applied to the Pacman game environment.

## Projects Overview

1. **Search Assignment:**
   - Implemented various search algorithms, including Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Uniform Cost Search (UCS), and A* Search, to navigate Pacman through mazes efficiently.
   
2. **Multi-Agent Search:**
   - Developed decision-making strategies using Minimax and Expectimax algorithms, accounting for both Pacman’s and ghosts’ actions. Explored adversarial search techniques with an evaluation function to improve Pacman’s gameplay.
   
3. **Reinforcement Learning (MDP & RL):**
   - Applied Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and reinforcement learning algorithms, including Q-learning and Value Iteration, to teach Pacman to make optimal decisions in stochastic environments.

4. **Tracking Assignment (Bayesian Networks):**
   - Implemented inference techniques in a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) framework to track Pacman’s position. Utilized Bayes Nets to model and infer Pacman’s belief states over time, improving ghost avoidance and tracking.
